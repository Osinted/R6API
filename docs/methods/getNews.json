Once activated, players will receive one free Operator from Year 1-7. This Operator will be randomly selected and will not include any Operators that the player has already unlocked.  \n\nThose who already own all Operators will receive a brand-new free headgear and uniform for the Operator Ying, as well as a brand-new signature weapon skin - holiday-themed of course! \n\nWe hope you enjoy this little gift from the team, and we wish you a great start to the new year.",
